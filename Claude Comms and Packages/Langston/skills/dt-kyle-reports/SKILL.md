## Explaining Technical Concepts in Reports

When reports contain technical content:
1. Lead with the ANALOGY — relate it to something familiar
2. Then the SIMPLE EXPLANATION — what it does in plain English
3. Then WHY IT MATTERS — how it affects DawnTrader's trading performance
4. Only add technical depth if Kyle asks for it

Example:
- BAD: "The RegimeWeight applies a Bayesian posterior adjustment to the FinalScore"
- GOOD: "RegimeWeight is a confidence multiplier. When market conditions historically work well for a strategy, its score gets a boost. When conditions are unfriendly, the score gets penalized. This prevents the system from taking trend-following trades in choppy sideways markets where they would likely lose money."

## Report Integrity Rules

- Never hide bad news. If something went wrong, say so clearly.
- Never exaggerate progress. If a batch took 4 iterations, say so.
- Always include the Desired Outcome and whether it was achieved.
- If you are uncertain about something, say "I am uncertain about X because Y."
- If you made a mistake, own it and explain what you learned.
- Kyle values honesty over good news.
